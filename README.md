# Scrimba-React-learn-react-3

This repository contains practice exercises and projects from the Scrimba React course, focusing on building React applications using hooks, components, and state management.

## Overview

This project explores advanced concepts in React development. It includes implementations of various components and covers key aspects such as state management, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and JSX.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **React Components** - Learn how to create reusable UI components.
2. **State Management** - Handle and update component state using hooks.
3. **Hooks** - Use React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for functional components.
4. **Props** - Pass data between components effectively.
5. **JSX** - Write clean, readable JSX to define the UI structure.

return (

<div>
<p>You clicked {count} times</p>
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
Click me
</button>
</div>
);
}

export default ExampleComponent;
